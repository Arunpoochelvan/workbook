Emulgel technology helps the gel to penetrate deeply into the skin to enhance delivery of diclofenac to the point of pain. Applying the gel 3 or 4 times a day produces a reservoir of the active ingredient diclofenac in your skin to provide a sustained source of diclofenac. The gel works by blocking production of some of the body’s chemicals that cause pain, tenderness and swelling (inflammation) – so relieving your pain to help restore your mobility!\n",

The gel helps the active ingredient diclofenac get through the skin barrier as well as offering a cooling effect to ease the painful and red areas of the body.\n",
            "How to use it\n",
            "The amount of gel needed will vary depending upon the size of the painful or swollen area. An amount ranging in size from 1 penny to a 2 pence piece will usually be sufficient. Apply 3 to 4 times a day unless your doctor, general practitioner or pharmacist tells you otherwise, and allow at least 4 hours between applications of the gel. Do not apply more than 4 times in any 24-hour period.\n",
            "Do not use the gel for longer than 14 days unless longer treatment has been recommended by a doctor. Consult your doctor if pain and swelling do not improve within 7 days. The gel is not recommended for use in children under 14 years of age.\n",

            "Voltarol Osteoarthritis Joint Pain Relief Gel is a medicated treatment containing a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The active ingredient (diclofenac) penetrates the skin to provide relief of pain and inflammation. It works differently from heat or cooling rubs, which contain ingredients that stimulate nerves in the skin, to provide a sensation of heating or cooling.\n",
            "Voltarol Osteoarthritis Joint Pain Relief Gel is non-greasy, with no strong odour.\n",
            "What does Emulgel mean?\n",
            "Emulgel is a technology designed for Voltarol Emulgel formulation. It helps the gel to penetrate deeply into the skin. In addition, the Emulgel technology uses a unique combination of a gel and cream to provide both a cooling and soothing effect when applied to the skin.\n",
            "How do I apply Voltarol Osteoarthritis Joint Pain Relief Gel?\n",
            "Gently rub or massage in a small amount of gel into the skin around the painful or swollen area. An amount ranging in size from a cherry to a walnut will usually be sufficient. However, the amount of gel needed will vary depending upon the size of the painful or swollen area. Check the label of the product you are using for correct dosage information.\n",
            "When should I NOT use Voltarol Osteoarthritis Joint Pain Relief Gel ?\n",
            "You are allergic to diclofenac, propylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, butylhydroxy toluene or any of the other ingredients\n",
            "You are in the last three months of pregnancy\n",
            "You have ever had an asthma attack or allergic reaction after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs such as diclofenac or ibuprofen\n",
            "You are under 14 years of age\n",
            "You are using other medicine containing diclofenac or taking oral NSAIDs such as aspirin or ibuprofen\n",
            "If you have any other health conditions or you are taking any other medications, including those that do not require a prescription, always ask your pharmacist or doctor if Voltarol Osteoarthritis Joint Pain Relief Gel is suitable for you. In addition, before you start using Voltarol Osteoarthritis Joint Pain Relief Gel , carefully read the product information leaflet included in the pack for instructions on how to use it.\n",
            "Voltarol Osteoarthritis Joint Pain Relief Gel\n",
            "should only be applied to healthy skin and not rubbed into open wounds, infections, open injuries or any other area where the skin is abnormal.\n",

            "Voltarol Osteoarthritis Joint Pain Relief Gel is non-greasy, with no strong odour.\n",
            "What does Emulgel mean?\n",
            "Emulgel is a technology designed for Voltarol Emulgel formulation. It helps the gel to penetrate deeply into the skin. In addition, the Emulgel technology uses a unique combination of a gel and cream to provide both a cooling and soothing effect when applied to the skin.\n",
            "How do I apply Voltarol Osteoarthritis Joint Pain Relief Gel?\n",
            "Gently rub or massage in a small amount of gel into the skin around the painful or swollen area. An amount ranging in size from a cherry to a walnut will usually be sufficient. However, the amount of gel needed will vary depending upon the size of the painful or swollen area. Check the label of the product you are using for correct dosage information.\n",
